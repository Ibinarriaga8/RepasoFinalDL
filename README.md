## SGD class (1 point)

This class is contained in the src.optimization module. This class is a custom implementation of SGD algorithm. The recommendation is to look at the documentation: link. To implement it you are not allowed to use pytorch methods (e.g. add, mul, div, etc).

## NAdam algorithm (1 point)

This class is contained in the src.optimization module. You will have to complete the constructor and step method. It is not allowed to use methods such as add or sub, only +, -, * and /. 
It is recommended to look at the steps of the algorithm in the PyTorch documentation.
